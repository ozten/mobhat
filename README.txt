server - A Kohana 2.3 web based application

database - Files relating to the MySQL databases which are used by the server


I started messing with CakePHP and then followed the tutorial. 

KISS - going with Kohana

setup SMB and shared all of /home/aking

oface.ubuntu is mapped to /home/aking/oface

development server notes:
VMWare - oface.ubuntu
MySQL - admin / pass
